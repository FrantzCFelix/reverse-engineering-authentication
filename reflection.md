## Reflection

Since I answered this later then expected. I will just answer the questions as if they are post bootcamp.

### The Journey so Far

I've learned that there is new stuff popping up everyday in the world of web devevelopment, that with enough practice, some web development technologys can be rewarding when you get a hang of them, such as React.

I've developed and deployed multiple applications. I also have have gained a much needed refresher and confidance boost from taking this course!

I've come to like web development alot and feel more capabale at landing a job.

### Path to Success

Post Course Goals are to get a job.

I hope to network a fair amout at demo day and utlimatly get a web dev job.

I will meet with my career coach and practice problem solving on my off time.

At the start I wasnt sure if I would like web dev, but I think I've found out most things in tech captivate my attention.
